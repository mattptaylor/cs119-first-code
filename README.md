# cs119-first-code
My first ever coding project. Created for cuyamaca college programming class during fall 2020.
This is lab 1 of the course which goes over basic programming concepts.This project is a great starting point for coding by learning the basics of variables, calculations, and outputting to the console.

multiply.py takes 2 integers from user input then multiplies them. The product is then output.

KmToMiles.py takes a float in kilometers as input, multiplies by 0.62 to convert to miles, then the resulting miles is output.

MilesToKm takes an float in miles from input, divides the value by 0.62 to convert to kilometers, then the resulting kilometers is output.
